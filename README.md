This is a basic WordPress starter theme bootstrapped with Local WP. To start off, create a new site and copy the site domain into the gulpfile.js proxy - I'd also turn on One-click admin in Local to avoid having to log in everytime you boot up WP Admin.

This theme has support for Custom Post Types and Advanced Custom Fields, so get those installed and set up if you wish.

If you're playing along at home, cd into the theme and install your node modules - gulp watch should start up browsersync as well as transpile any scss into the main css file in the root.
